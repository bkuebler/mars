Description: MARSlight module in DKMS format.
 MARS Light is a block-level storage replication system for long distances
 / flaky networks under GPL. It runs as a Linux kernel module. The sysadmin
 interface is similar to other distributed block-level replications, but its
 internal engine is completely different. It works with transaction logging,
 similar to some database systems.
 .
 Therefore, MARS Light can provide stronger consistency guarantees. Even
 in case of network bottlenecks / problems / failures, the secondaries may 
 become outdated (reflect an elder state), but never become inconsistent.
 In contrast to DRBD, MARS Light preserves the order of write operations even
 when the network is flaky (Anytime Consistency). The current version of 
 MARS Light works asynchronously. Therefore, application performance is 
 completely decoupled from any network problems. Future versions are planned 
 to also support synchronous or near-synchronous modes.
